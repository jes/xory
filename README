Xory - picture-guessing game
============================

Introduction
------------

Xory implements an interface for playing and creating picture-guessing games.
The name comes from the question "X or Y?" which is the basis of the game.
The user is presented with a series of pictures, and is tasked with guessing
the category that each picture fits in.

The user is also able to create a Xory game using his own categories and
pictures.

Xory is available online at http://xory.pm/

Technical
---------

Xory is implemented as a Mojolicious::Lite app, using Bootstrap 3 for the UI.
DBM::Deep is used for the database, though this is questionable and warrants
replacement.
